# EDA-of-DC-Residential-Properties

## Proposal
In the first project, we mainly use linear regression models to find the impact of Floor Plan, Location, Time and Facilities on prices. Then we use the ANOVA test and correlation plot to confirm our assumption. However, due to the limitations of the linear regression model and the complexity of data. Our final result was not exact. After continuing learning, we have mastered more methods to classify and deal with different types of variables, and we believe that we can get more accurate and satisfied result. Furthermore, the methods we learned, such as KNN and Time series, enable us to make more accurate predictions with existing data.
Based on the progress of the previous project and what has been learned. We have three SMART Questions about today's topic:
1. Whether the price and sales volume have some systematic pattern over the time period?
2. How to predict the price by K nearest neighbor?
3. How to predict and classify the condition of a property?

## Dataset
The dataset was derived from Kaggle, which was derived from https://www.kaggle.com/christophercorrea/dc-residential-properties. We have completed data cleaning in the first project. The file `DC_Properties.csv` contains 125k rows and 49 columns.
